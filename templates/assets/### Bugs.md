### Bugs

- In Assets List, click on 'Edit', takes you to edit asset page. Click 'cancel'. Does not go back to the asset list page -- Fixed
- Tickets can be viewed directly without entering access code by entering the url directly -- Fixed
- Email does not seem to work as it lacks text based version of the emails -- Probably expired SMTP key (will check later)
- For Active class for pages that have edit/update forms for resources like edit asset, edit technician/users, delete asset/users etc, in base.html template, add url and compare -- What??
