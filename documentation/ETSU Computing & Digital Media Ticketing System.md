No login is required to submit or check the status of tickets.

2. Click on "Submit Ticket" in the navigation menu
3. Complete the ticket submission form:
    - **Email Address**: Use your ETSU email (@etsu.edu)
    - **Phone Number**: Optional, but helpful for urgent matters
    - **Your Name**: Your full name
    - **Subject**: Brief description of your issue
    - **Description**: Detailed explanation of your problem or request

## Responding to Updates

When Liz or a student technician responds to your ticket, you'll receive an email notification with:

- The response message
- A new access code
- A link to view and respond to the ticket

**Important**: Each email provides a new access code. Always use the most recent code when checking your ticket.

## Best Practices for Effective Support

1. **Be Specific**: Include details about what you were doing when the issue occurred
2. **One Ticket Per Issue**: Submit separate tickets for unrelated problems
3. **Include Location**: Specify building and room number for on-site assistance
4. **Attach Screenshots**: Visual evidence helps diagnose issues faster
5. **Provide Availability**: Mention when you're available for in-person assistance
6. **Include Priority**: Note any urgent deadlines or teaching schedules affected
